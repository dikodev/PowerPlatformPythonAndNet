# Lab 4 - Testing a Custom Connector

Now that you've created a Custom Connector and added all the necessary actions, it is now time to test it to make sure that it's working properly. Testing anything you've created is very important.

1. To ensure that we're testing the latest changes, click the ```✓ Update connector``` button.

2. Every connector needs a connection for it to work so under the *Connections* section, click ```+ New Connection```.
